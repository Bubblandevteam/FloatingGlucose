## Hidden / Nice to Know features
* You can drag the window around and place it where you want to.
* To show the settings again, please right click the notification area icon or the app. A menu will pop up allowing you to access the application settings
* The same pop up menu can be used to temporarily disable sound alarms.

## Debugging
Having troubles with crashes or with the widget not updating? Please make sure you have enabled exception logging to stderr (in the configfile) then run the program from command line:

```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\FloatingGlucose"
FloatingGlucose.exe 2> glucose_log.txt
```

Then open glucose_log.txt

## Settings files
Please note that you can edit the settings from inside the application. If you still need to access the conig files directly, please go to either of these locations

* Installation directory, and open FloatingGlucose.exe.config
* %localappdata%\Bjorns_opensource_utils and locate user.config

The user.config file will override any values inside the FloatingGlucose.exe.config file
